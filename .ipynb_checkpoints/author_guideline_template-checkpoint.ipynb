Its visualization is an innovative compound object comprising one network visualization in which doctoral theses are arranged according to their lexical similarity, computed with natural language processing and machine learning techniques. In addition, a circularly-bent line chart frames the network into a circle that shows the frequency of publication over the year and allows visitors to select a period to explore information."

    "The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (_École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne_, or EPFL) is a young university celebrating its 50th anniversary. The EPFL hosted many events for this event, including an exhibition tracing its history via digital archives. This exhibition, called _Infinity Room 2_, was organized by Prof. Sarah Kenderdine, director of the Laboratory of Experimental Museology (eM+) and EPFL Pavilions, the institutional museum designed by the acclaimed architect Kengo Kuma. Infinity Room 2 was inaugurated in September 2019 in the wooden building of EPFL Pavilions."

    "This article is focused on the archives regarding academic practice and its evolution. Since the advent of information systems, the multifaceted practice of researchers, teachers, and professors <cite data-cite=\"1465847/WBHF5924\"></cite> has been saved and stored for administrative and research purposes during a progressive process of datafication <cite data-cite=\"1465847/JS73NI4F\"></cite>. As a part of the exhibition Infinity Room 2, the project _Super-Vision_ aims to represent one dimension of academic activities, supervision. Supervision is synonymous with academic advising, which refers explicitly to “situations in which an institutional representative gives insight or direction to a college student about an academic, social or personal matter” <cite data-cite=\"1465847/VIKANIT7\"></cite>. Specifically, the project narrows down to a specific product of academic advising, doctoral studies. The goal is to retrace EPFL’s footsteps by visualizing the records of the Ph.D. theses defended over five decades to offer scientists and museum visitors an overview of the growth that brought EPFL to take first place in the academic ranking of young universities.\n"

Computational museology allows us to conceive new trajectories that link all forms of cultural materiality: objects, knowledge systems, representation and participation. Following key definitions, the authors: outline state of the art in archival access and museological engagement through a series of examples; examine advances in the computational analysis of archives exploring forward-looking trends for massive digital cultural archives; and introduce an upcoming project, Narratives from the long tail: transforming access to audiovisual archives.",
