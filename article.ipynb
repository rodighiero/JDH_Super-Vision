    "The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (_École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne_, or EPFL) is a young university celebrating its 50th anniversary. The EPFL hosted many events for this anniversary, including a special exhibition tracing its history via digital archives. This exhibition, called _Infinity Room 2_, was organized by Prof. Sarah Kenderdine, director of the Laboratory of Experimental Museology (eM+) and EPFL Pavilions, the institutional museum designed by the acclaimed architect Kengo Kuma. Infinity Room 2 was inaugurated in September 2019 in the wooden building of EPFL Pavilions."

As a part of the exhibition Infinity Room 2, the project _Super-Vision_ aims to represent one dimension of academic activities, supervision. Supervision is synonymous with academic advising, which refers explicitly to “situations in which an institutional representative gives insight or direction to a college student about an academic, social or personal matter” (<cite data-cite=\"1465847/VIKANIT7\"></cite>). Specifically, the project narrows down to a specific product of academic advising, doctoral studies. The goal is to retrace EPFL’s footsteps by visualizing the records of the Ph.D. theses defended over five decades to offer scientists and museum visitors an overview of the growth that brought EPFL to take first place in the academic ranking of young universities.\n"

    "Infinity Room 2 occurs when cultural institutions establish interdisciplinary collaborations under the acronym of GLAM, which stands for “galleries, libraries, archives, and museums” (Australian Society of Archivists, 2003). Empowered by the digital turn, the GLAM initiative now invests time and energy in digital archives, especially digitalization, preservation, and visualization (Cameron & Kenderdine, 2007). In the context delineated by GLAM, Super-Vision is a work of experimental museology at the intersection between Science and Technology Studies (STS) and science mapping (Börner, 2010, 2015). Indeed, both disciplines aim to understand the science in the making: while STS reinterprets museums as observatories to look at science, in science mapping, the scholars use data visualizations as an instrument to reveal patterns and structures.\n"

    "Origins of this intersection of different domains are rooted in STS, which analyzes the many aspects of science in their historical, cultural, and social context. In 1986, Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar published a revolutionary book, Laboratory Life, unveiling the process of science-making at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies (Latour and Woolgar, 1986). Previously, science appeared in publications, conferences, and awards, but this book drastically changed the public’s perception of science. The daily life of scientists was disclosed by observing them in their environment, like studying gorillas in their natural habitat. As pointed out in the book’s preface by the institute’s funder Jonas Salk, although scientists felt uncomfortable being observed, the study provided valuable information for understanding the scientific environment. Latour and Woolgar, in particular, introduced an innovative way to look at science, contributing to developing the concept of “science in the making,” which aims to reveal the human, relational, and technological making of science (Shapin, 1992).\n"

    "A few years later, when curators Barbara Vanderlinden and Hans Ulrich Obrist organized the exhibition Laboratorium, which took place in 1999 at the Provinciaal Fotografie Museum in Antwerp, perhaps they did not expect to create a so-solid partnership between STS and museology (Gorman, 2020). Their exhibition prompted questions about the perception of science by the general public, investigating “the gap between the specialized vocabulary of science, art, and the general interest of the audience” by looking at the museum gallery as a scientific laboratory to run experiments (Obrist and Vanderlinden, 2001). The science in the making was thus addressed to a broader audience by bringing scientific practice into museums. At that time, Bruno Latour and Peter Galison were put in touch with Caroline Jones and Peter Weibel, generating a spark that led later to four exhibitions curated by Latour and Weibel at the Zentrum für Kunst und Medien (Latour & Leclercq, 2016; Latour & Weibel, 2002, 2005, 2020). This encounter between scholars and curators is a landmark in the collaboration between science and museums, giving fresh perspectives on how museums can establish scientific dialogues with their public.\n"

    "When scientific works became part of exhibitions, “old museum collections and new technologies come together, tracing the translation and extension of collections from card catalogues, storerooms and display cases into digital websites, imaging platforms and collection management systems” (Geismar, 2018, p. xviii). Museum collections, for example, are increasingly undergoing a digitalization process to be widely accessible, as in the case of 250,000 artworks and 10 million annotations provided by Harvard Art Museums. Another significant aspect of digital technology is the introduction of digital devices and exhibition objects to support museum activity (Isaac, 2008). Along with digital uses related to painting, photography, sculpture, installations, videos, and software art (Paul, 2015), also the practice of data visualization entered museums (Manovich, 2018). For example, the celebrated Museum of Modern Art was among the first institutions to showcase data visualizations, including in its permanent collection works by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec (2016) or Vladan Joler and Kate Crawford (2018). As early as 2008, Paola Antonelli included data-visualization artifacts in the exhibition Design and the Elastic Mind to emphasize designers’ ability to understand the changes in technology and society through objects (Antonelli, 2008; Cogdell, 2009). Since then, more and more museums have embraced data visualizations as centerpieces in their exhibitions.\n"

In a historical moment when universities devote more attention to public opinion, opening increasingly public spaces to host visitors, Super-Vision fits into a small niche where the work of scientists is made public in their organizations. The recent construction of EPFL Pavilions imitates the renowned American institutes, which host museums on the campus for visitors and pedagogical purposes, as in the case of Harvard Art Museums (Cuno, 1996). Scientists can now communicate with a broader audience through museums, making their work transparent and accessible. As this case demonstrates, Super-Vision is a project that addresses its message firstly to EPFL staff and students and secondly to the alums and all those individuals who have ever had a personal relationship with this organization. Internally, the goal is to create a sense of belonging and a greater awareness of the organization; externally, Super-Vision can be seen as an experiment of digital history in which the visualization of digital archives aims at telling a story to visitors.\n"

    "Data visualization is the technical means through which Super-Vision reveals EPFL scientific practice to visitors. Despite the availability of different digital archives, the collection of 8,000 doctoral theses was chosen because capable of presenting an unusual view of the institution. This archive is publicly accessible through Infoscience, an information system maintained by the EPFL library to collect and maintain institutional literature. Since many scientific publications are affected by copyright restrictions (MIT Libraries, 2019), doctoral theses have the rare quality of being freely accessible along with their metadata. In addition, these collections are usually characterized by a continuous flow of publications over time, a fundamental dimension for time-based analysis. The totality of these characteristics permits to traverse of two aspects of archival information. On the one hand, documents can be explored through their textual dimension (Meirelles 2013,  185-203) using techniques of natural language processing; on the other hand, the frequency can reveal invisible patterns about the evolution of the university.\n"

An outer circle frames the visualization working as a line chart in which the frequency is represented. The two statistical dimensions of the network and the line chart show EPFL doctoral theses by similarity and time, offering a complementary look at two sides of the same coin.

    "The network visualization comprises gray dots, which embody successful doctoral defenses. By clicking on one thesis, the user gets the title and the candidate’s name, faculty, and director/s. Each thesis is surrounded by similar works, representing the scientific neighborhood in which candidates advanced similar research topics. The metric of lexical similarity between the theses is based on text analysis (Manning & Schütze, 1999). Titles, abstracts, and the first ten pages of full texts are analyzed and compared by word frequency using a technique called term frequency-inverse document frequency, which finds the most relevant terms compared to the entire corpus (Salton et al., 1975). The matrix resulting from this operation is successively translated through another algorithm belonging to the family of artificial intelligence, dimensionality reduction. The dimensionality reduction technique decreases the whole lexicon from a high-dimensional space to the two dimensions of the Cartesian plane, enabling mapping (McInnes et al., 2018). The effectiveness of the spatial arrangement is proven by the structure of faculties, revealed by interaction. By clicking on a thesis, the faculty’s ramified structure glows in the background. Its ramified extension is identified by the Urquhart graph, which removes each triangle’s most extended edges in the Delaunay triangulation, thus simplifying network connectivity (Urquhart, 1980). The doctoral theses of each faculty are grouped in one or two clusters, indicating a similarity in the lexicon employed. Such proximity suggests that the frequency-based metric used to organize the theses was successful. A scattered structure, on the contrary, would have corresponded to a non-uniform corpus, indicating a potential risk of data inconsistency.\n"

This ranking indicates the fastest-growing universities in the last fifty years, whose goal is to highlight the institutions without a century-old history. This timeline is not only an infographic but also an interface controller to move through time. By dragging its curve-shaped handler, the theses being defended in that specific time window bounce in and out to capture the user’s attention. Also, the handler’s length shortens with time because theses increase is significant. During the 1960s, there was roughly one doctoral defense per month, while EPFL today exceeds one thesis per day. To a keen eye, this stunning insight is not only a statistical increase but also points out the institution’s politics of preventing permanent positions in the intermediary staff, preferring to invest money in less-expensive doctoral students to advance research. The timeline also shows how some theses are older than the institution itself. The reason is that EPFL was previously part of the University of Lausanne, from which it was separated in 1969, making it the second Swiss federal institute along with ETH Zürich. This political decision allowed the creation of another polytechnical school to balanced French- and German-speaking institutes in the federation.\n"

The static nature of the network is mitigated by an animation that wakes up dots via interaction. The result is a multidimensional visualization that uses interaction design to reveal insights. This combination shows us how information and interaction design are intimately connected by their shared goal of understanding data, as Manuel Lima openly discussed in a recent interview (XXX, 2021).\n"

Since data visualization is a recent research subject, its transversality allows scholars to cover the distance between disciplines, just as computer science did in the last decades. The subsequent developments in data visualization have to be followed closely, mainly when associated with public spaces. And museums provide an opportunity to give a physical space for data visualization. Compared to the more rigid structure of academia, museums freely move and experiment in the space between art and science, blurring its borders. As Hans Ulrich Obrist and Barbara Vanderlinden mentioned, museums can be seen as scientific laboratories where scholars can experiment more freely.\n"

     "abstract": "This article addresses the potential for computational practises within archival and museological domains by charting a positional shift occurring in digital archives; from working with an object orientation and containment – to computing with a dimension orientation, segmentation, analytics and visualization. Computational museology allows us to conceive new trajectories that link all forms of cultural materiality: objects, knowledge systems, representation and participation. Following key definitions, the authors: outline state of the art in archival access and museological engagement through a series of examples; examine advances in the computational analysis of archives exploring forward-looking trends for massive digital cultural archives; and introduce an upcoming project, Narratives from the long tail: transforming access to audiovisual archives.",

The conventional media for visualizations is the computer screen, a visual device that supports the practices of design and reading. However, visualizations also appear in other ways, for example as posters, articles, books, or projections. This article focuses, in particular, on a pretty unusual medium called floor or walkable visualization.",
